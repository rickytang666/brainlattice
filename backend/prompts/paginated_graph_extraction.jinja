analyze the attached document and extract the knowledge graph data for a SPECIFIC subset of concept IDs.

you are provided with a batch of concept IDs below. your strictly limited task is to extract the directional links ONLY
for these specific concepts based on the attached document.

target concept IDs (extract ONLY these):
{{ batch_ids | join(', ') }}

strict output rules:
1. return only a valid json object with key "nodes".
2. nodes format:
{
"nodes": [
{
"id": "concept name lowercase",
"aliases": ["alias1", "alias2"],
"outbound_links": ["child concept 1", "dependency 2"],
"inbound_links": ["parent concept", "broader category"]
}
]
}
3. scopes: the "nodes" array MUST ONLY contain objects whose "id" exactly matches one of the target concept IDs listed
above. do not create nodes for any other concepts.
4. ids: must be exactly identical to the provided target concept IDs.
5. outbound_links & inbound_links: concepts this node points to or is pointed by.
6. **cross-linking**: when adding concepts to "outbound_links" or "inbound_links", you are STRONGLY encouraged to use
IDs from the global master list of concepts provided below whenever possible, to ensure the graph connects properly.

global master list of concept IDs (use these for linking):
{{ global_ids | join(', ') }}

7. return raw json only. do not wrap your response in ```json or any code block.
