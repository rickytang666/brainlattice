analyze the following document skeleton (table of contents/headers) and identify the Core Root Concepts.

Skeleton:
{{ skeleton_text }}

Rules:
1. Return a valid JSON object with key "nodes".
2. nodes format:
{
"id": "concept name lowercase",
"aliases": ["synonym1", "acronym"],
"outbound_links": ["child concept 1", "dependency 2"],
"inbound_links": ["parent concept", "broader category"]
}
3. Identify only the HIGH-LEVEL PARENT CONCEPTS (e.g. "multivariate calculus", "linear algebra", "integration")
represented by the
headers.
4. Do NOT extract every single sub-header, only the major organizing topics that other concepts will loop back to.
5. IDs must be lowercase, singular.
