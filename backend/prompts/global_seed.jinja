analyze the attached document and identify the core concepts.

your goal is to generate a comprehensive, deduplicated master list of all fundamental theoretical concepts, recurring
entities, and core methodologies discussed in the entire text. this list will serve as the global ontology for a
knowledge graph.

strict output rules:
1. return a valid json array of strings. do NOT wrap the array in an object (e.g. `["concept1", "concept2"]`).
2. ids: must be lowercase, singular, and use spaces instead of underscores (e.g. "deep learning", not "deep_learning").
3. **encyclopedic standard**: every id must be a valid potential wikipedia page title.
- bad: "discussion of integrals", "understanding limits", "chapter 1", "solving equations"
- good: "integral", "limit", "linear equation"
4. **exhaustive but deduplicated**: ensure you extract all meaningful concepts across the entire document. if the
document uses synonyms (e.g., "gradient descent" and "steepest descent"), pick the most canonical term and only output
that one ID.
5. do not include meta-discourse phrases like "discussion of", "overview of", "types of", "introduction to". extract the
core concept only.
6. return raw json only. do not wrap your response in ```json or any code block.
