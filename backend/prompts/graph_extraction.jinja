analyze the following text and identify key concepts (nodes) and their directed relationships (outbound links)

{% if existing_concepts -%}
Existing Concept IDs (REUSE THESE IF APPLICABLE): {{ existing_concepts | join(', ') }}
{%- endif %}

strict output rules:
1. return only a valid json object with key "nodes"
2. nodes format: 
   {
     "id": "concept name lowercase", 
     "aliases": ["synonym1", "acronym"],
     "outbound_links": ["target concept id 1", "target concept id 2"]
   }
3. ids: must be lowercase, singular, and use spaces instead of underscores (e.g. "deep learning", not "deep_learning")
4. outbound_links: concepts this node points to or relies on based on the text
5. validate: ensure every id in "outbound_links" is either in current "nodes" list or in "existing concept ids" list
6. reuse ids: if a concept matches an id in "existing concept ids" (or is a synonym), use that existing id
