analyze the following text and identify key concepts (nodes) and their directed relationships (outbound links)

try your best to identifying concepts (try not miss anything) and build connections if possible.

{% if existing_concepts -%}
Existing Concept IDs (REUSE THESE IF APPLICABLE): {{ existing_concepts | join(', ') }}
{%- endif %}

strict output rules:
1. return only a valid json object with key "nodes"
2. nodes format:
{
"id": "concept name lowercase",
"aliases": ["synonym1", "acronym"],
"outbound_links": ["child concept 1", "dependency 2"],
"inbound_links": ["parent concept", "broader category"]
}
3. ids: must be lowercase, singular, and use spaces instead of underscores (e.g. "deep learning", not "deep_learning")
4. **encyclopedic standard**: every id must be a valid potential wikipedia page title.
- bad: "discussion of integrals", "understanding limits", "chapter 1", "solving equations"
- good: "integral", "limit", "linear equation"
5. **negative constraints**: do not include meta-discourse phrases like "discussion of", "overview of", "types of",
"introduction to". extract the core concept only.
6. outbound_links: concepts this node points to, relies on, or contains (children)
7. inbound_links: concepts that contain this node or are broader categories (parents). *critical*: even if the parent
concept is not explicitly in the text, infer it if obvious (e.g. "level curve" -> "multivariate calculus").
8. validate: ensure every id in "outbound_links" or "inbound_links" is valid concept format
9. reuse ids: if a concept matches an id in "existing concept ids" (or is a synonym), use that existing id
